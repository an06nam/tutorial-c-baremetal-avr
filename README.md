***THE CONTENT ARE MADE ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE A BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ELECTRONICS AND C PROGRMMING LANGUAGE***


This repo will contain material of my youtube video as a reference for you to follow along my journey lerning bare metal C on an avr microcontroller.
I mainly use linux (debian based) as my main operating system, but I will also cover the setup process for Windows.
